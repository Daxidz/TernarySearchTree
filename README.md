## Description
This is a small project I had to develop with my two working mates, David and Dany.

Basically, this is a spell checker. You can pass a few options to the command-line.
We had to implement it in two ways:
* with an `std::unordered_set` ;
* with a *Ternary Search Tree* which was entirely implemented by us.

The complexity of the program can be increased with a balanced *Ternary Search Tree*
but we didn't have time for that.

A little documentation is available in the [files/](files/) directory.

Feel free to contribute to code if you want to.


## Compiling
Before compiling anything, please make sure that the `Makefile` is in line with your
system specifications.
